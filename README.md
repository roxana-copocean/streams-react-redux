# React app with redux, hooks, and Google Auth

## The App consists of:
- Streams\api - where I fetch and save data
- Streams\newclientclient - the UI where we can create and view streams (the Google authorization only handles access to Create, Edit and Delete )

## The app is dependent on (besides the node modules)
- Google APIs - only for signin with 'gapi.auth2'
